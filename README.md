# DARNN for drought forecasting
In this repository, you can find the code of the implementation of two-stage attention-based RNN for drought level forecasting for the Alibaba Tianchi who participated in the Global AI Innovation Challenge Series 2021 Intelligent Weather Forecast for Better Life. We are forecasting the Drought Level by using the open data offered by the NASA POWER Project and the authors of the US Drought Monitor. We have already used Alibaba Cloud services for implementing our AI Architecture on DSW Development Environment.
We have developed an AI Architecture which forecasts the Drought Level with high-level accuracy. Our system is capable of Monitoring the environment, specifying the drought areas, forecasting the drought level, and alarming the authorities for extreme events.
In the repository file, we have already uploaded our Python scripts including training, predicting, web API, etc. Furthermore, we have implemented our architecture on DSW (Data Science Workshop) which illustrates in the provided video demo.
